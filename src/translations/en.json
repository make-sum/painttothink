        "question": "Can my landlord charge me for normal wear and tear?",

      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for peeling paint?",
        "answer": "Your landlord. Peeling paint is a habitability issue. They must maintain the property in habitable condition, including fixing peeling or damaged paint.",

        "lawCode": "Cal. Civ. Code § 1950.5(b)(2)",

        "citation": "\"The landlord may not assert a claim against the tenant for...deterioration which results from normal wear and tear.\"",
